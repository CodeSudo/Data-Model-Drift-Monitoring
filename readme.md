# Data and Model Drift Monitoring Project

This project aims to monitor and detect data and model drift in a machine learning system. Data and model drift refer to the changes that occur in the input data distribution and the model's performance over time, which can significantly impact the system's accuracy and reliability.

## Features

- Continuous monitoring of input data distribution.
- Tracking and comparison of model performance metrics.
- Alerting mechanism for detecting and notifying data and model drift.
- Visualization of drift detection results.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: [Python 竊余(https://www.python.org/)
- Machine Learning Framework: [TensorFlow 竊余(https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- Data Visualization: [Matplotlib 竊余(https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn 竊余(https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   `````bash
   git clone https://github.com/codesudo/data-model-drift-monitoring.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ````bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Configure the monitoring settings in the `config.py` file.
2. Run the data and model drift monitoring script:

   ````bash
   python monitor_drift.py
   ```

   This script will periodically collect data, evaluate the model's performance, and generate drift detection reports.

3. Check the generated reports and visualizations in the designated output directory.
